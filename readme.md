# KANSEN at war

## What is this

This is a naval war sim game, but cointains no scripts, only progame. My original intention is to design a hardcore game based on the settings and cute girls in game Azurlane, but it shuold not be too difficult to create a scripts based on simliar games. In order to avoid charges on copyrights and save space, there is no content from the game here in this repository, but I will provide a small programe to convert the asserts into the resources the game can use. It is now far from playable, and there is no guarantee that this project can be finished. Any help is welcome and I'll try my best to make these code easy to maintance.

## Other important stuff about gameplay
